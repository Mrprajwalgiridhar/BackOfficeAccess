i need an html which will create an impex and provide to user

Step 1 : User will enter and email in input. ex: prajwal.g@ff.com

Java script : when the user enters the email it should decode the email and create 3 properties and store it in variables.

Ex:

firstName = Prajwal (the first word of name should be in Capital)
lastName = G (the first word of name should be in Capital)
userName = prajwal.g (everything should be in lowercase)

Step 2 : user will select which access he need in dropdown option 

Ex: there will be more option with regions where user is selecting the region to create an impex to provide the access to the email entered

Java script : when the user an region from dropdown option it should go to the xl stored in a path and take a accessType code from the xl sheet respective to the region (in Xl sheet there will be a sheet called AccessType. in that sheet there will be a table with 2 column A(regions) and B(accessTypes)).and store that in a variable property.

for your refrence -> table

Regions	AccessTypes
Admin	HCBO_Admin_Group
 CA	HCBO_CA_Group
 US	HCBO_US_Group
 BR	HCBO_BR_Group
 CO	HCBO_CO_Group
 MX	HCBO_MX_Group
 ANZ	HCBO_ANZ_Group
 KH	HCBO_KH_Group
 CN	HCBO_CN_Group
 IND	HCBO_IND_Group
 ID	HCBO_ID_Group
 JP	HCBO_JP_Group
 MY	HCBO_MY_Group
 MM	HCBO_MM_Group
 PH	HCBO_PH_Group
 SG	HCBO_SG_Group
 TH	HCBO_TH_Group
 VN	HCBO_VN_Group
 DK	HCBO_DK_Group
 FI	HCBO_FI_Group
 FR	HCBO_FR_Group
 DE	HCBO_DE_Group
 IE	HCBO_IE_Group
 IL	HCBO_IL_Group
 IT	HCBO_IT_Group

 PT	HCBO_PT_Group
 ES	HCBO_ES_Group
 SE	HCBO_SE_Group
 GB	HCBO_GB_Group
 EG	HCBO_EG_Group


Step 3 : User will click on "generate impex" button and impex should be created.

java script : when the user click on the button then javascript should fetch the impex file stored in a path and replace with the variables stored and display the text in text area.

Ex:

in impex there are some place holders like follows:
<userName> = userName
<firstName> = firstName
<lastName> = lastName
<accessType> = accessType

these should be replaced with the stored variables.
